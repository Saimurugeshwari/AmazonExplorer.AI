🌎 AmazonExplorer.AI
AI-Assisted Exploration Tool for Remote Archaeology and Environmental Research

AmazonExplorer.AI empowers archaeologists, researchers, and explorers with AI-driven insights from satellite + LIDAR data. Draw a region on the map, state your research goal, and receive a multilingual, downloadable report — with risk ratings, historical context, vegetation analysis, and even a voice note for on-the-go listening.

-Features Overview
Feature	Description
- Interactive Map (Leaflet)	Explore Amazonia with layered LIDAR and satellite overlays.
-Region Selection + Prompt	Draw AOI (Area of Interest) and define a research question.
-GPT-4 Insights	Terrain, anomalies, historical notes, and expedition feasibility.
- Archaeological Tile Ranking	Tiles are scored by GPT based on potential interest.
- Accessibility Scanner	Warns about no-road zones and risky terrain.
-Route Estimator	Simulates safest access routes based on fires/roads.
- Vegetation / Plant Suitability	Soil and crop potential estimated via NDVI and GPT.
-Historical Context Prompts	GPT adds known regional facts or cultural data (e.g., Kuhikugu).
-PDF Report Generator	AI-generated report includes tile map, summary, and risks.
-Voice Summary (gTTS/Whisper)	Download short voice notes in multiple languages.
-AskGPT Mode	Gradio chatbot to continue your research Q&A.
-Save Research	Save results to dashboard or download for field use.

Built Around Real Researcher Needs
Research Goal	What AmazonExplorer Delivers
“What can we plant here?”	GPT interprets NDVI to rate soil fertility + suggest crops.
“Is this area safe to explore?”	Fire zones, roads, distance → route simulation + risk tags.
“Is there any historical context?”	GPT includes known cultural/archaeological facts.
“How dense is this terrain?”	Forest density from LIDAR + access notes via GPT.
“How far is the nearest access point?”	GPT highlights distance to road/river and expedition plan.

MVP Roadmap Summary
Phase 1: Foundations
Choose pilot region (e.g., Xingu near Kuhikugu)

Setup Leaflet map + LIDAR overlay

FastAPI backend: analyze, save, respond

Phase 2: AI Pipeline
GPT generates “area profiles” based on selected tiles

Task-to-query translation (e.g., "look near rivers")

LIDAR anomaly detection (ring ditches, elevation bumps)

Phase 3: Research Exports
Multilingual reports (EN, PT, ES, FR)

PDF + audio note generation

Tile ranking system (GPT scoring)

Phase 4: Expedition Planner
Access routes, road/fire overlays

Risk summaries from GPT

Phase 5: Polish + Submit
End-to-end walkthrough video

Sample data: JSON, PDF, .mp3

Screenshot set for judging panel

Tech Stack
Layer	Tool
-Frontend	HTML + Leaflet.js + Gradio
-Backend	FastAPI (Python)
-AI	GPT-4 (OpenAI), gTTS for TTS
-Data	Sentinel-2, OpenTopography LIDAR
-Reports	WeasyPrint (HTML → PDF)
-Hosting	Kaggle Notebooks (MVP), GitHub for version control

How It Works
User selects a region from the map.

Enters research goal (e.g., “look for ancient settlements near rivers”).

Backend pulls tile coordinates and invokes:

LIDAR + Satellite overlay

GPT to generate area summary + risk + tile ranking

gTTS to create audio note

WeasyPrint to generate PDF

User views the result, exports PDF/audio, or saves to dashboard.
